This will serve as an endpoint.
Users will go to {ip_addr}:{port} and login to get access to end point


Have one folder called public_share where everything in there can then be accessed from endpoint. 
Login to get access to those files.
Either download those files, or play those files on device


Other PCs make request to head to become a child
once head accepts, the child recieves a download file which is a child-endpoint socket server
this socket server lives in the background and allows the head to connect to the children


in the future implement a tree file structure
