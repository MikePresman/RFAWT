#This will serve as an endpoint.
Users will go to {ip_addr}:{port} and login to get access to end point


Have one folder called public_share where everything in there can then be accessed from endpoint. 
Login to get access to those files.
Either download those files, or play those files on device


Other PCs make request to head to become a child
once head accepts, the child recieves a download file which is a child-endpoint socket server
this socket server lives in the background and allows the head to connect to the children


in the future implement a tree file structure

child downloads file request, file request is a server which connects to the "socket" of the head. And then it sends data to the head

1a. on server setup it needs to make search for a folder LAN-explorer or make one
1. Work on setting up database to store all IP's and ports
2. when user adds new ip and port - it gets added to database
3. on page "explore network" it will try connecting to each, if successful keep that in mind then return the explore network page as different links to different PCs
4. when clicking on a pc open connection
5. make server into executable that outputs port and ip



run on mac to make windows requests



flask run --host=0.0.0.0

make this work where the server for the web app doesnt also need to run a server to get its own stuff

Router - Port Forwarding, TCP/UDP, public and private Port is 5000, IP is the LAN IP of the computer running the web server

implement search bar for searching specific directories
